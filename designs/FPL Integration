I want to be able to filter upcoming fixtures by fixtures that I have players in

Bill creates a new account on the site.  He first chooses team preferences along with an option to log in to FPL.
He chooses to log-in via FPL and add fixtures with players he has on his team.  A pop-up window appears prompting for
FPL username and password (and team ID?), along with a checkbox that, when checked, will change the preference to keep
prompting for an FPL password.  He logs in successfully, and the home-screen is generated with all the upcoming fixtures
for his preference teams as well as teams with players that he has on his FPL roster.  Only the upcoming gameweek is
displayed initially, with a button at the bottom to load all past matches, and a button near the top to load future
matches.

Designs to follow:
(1) Add preferences option to home screen/ add top/bottom bar to home screen
(2) Add FPL pop-up log in
(3) Add FPL to preferences
(4) Add backend logic for filtering fixtures by FPL player inclusion
(5) Add filtering for only this gameweek
(6) Add buttons for loading more gameweeks
