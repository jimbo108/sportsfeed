12/31/19 2:51AM - Finished initializing teams data, now looking at initializing mappings as well.
		  May be looking to use fantasy epl API for everything at first (rather than football-data,
		  with fantasy EPL data to grab teams that you have players on), but the APIs are
		  not currently working.  May still want to stick with football-data.org to branch
		  out to other leagues (and also not sure what the data differences are).

01/05/20 2:02AM - Finished initializing all data, now working on preferences
          view and model -- base case functional and unit coverage is complete,
          now working on the functionality.

03/10/20 1:09AM - Finisehd models and design for home.  Need to create a client class
for getting the match resources.

03/20/20 12:01AM - Finished code (untested) for the home view.  Working on migrations for
RequestLimitType and RequestType.  I've also discovered that I need to create a new  migration
for TeamMapping, since I've changed 'team' to 'value' with the new MappingModel parent class,
and it also appears that I've used *_id rather than *__id, and django will just do whatever you
tell it in custom migrations.  I'm not sure how the TeamMapping custom migrations interacts with
the original migration that created the tables.
