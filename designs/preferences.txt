There are two sources of truth for the teams associated with a player:
	1) The API server, and more specifically a primary ID associated with the team
	2) The local server, ''

We need to maintain a mapping between these two sources.  Each EPL team will originate in the
local server as models initialized by json.  These models will be pointed to by a mapping table
with the following columns:

1) Internal Team Identifier
2) API ForeignKey
3) API Primary ID (from response, no pointer to an actual local row)

So there will be a total of 5 tables/models involved:

1) Team - home 
	a) id
	b) name
2) TeamMapping - home
	a) id
	b) team (FK)
	c) api (FK)
	d) external_id
3) API - home
	a) id
	b) name
4) User (built-in) - N/A
5) TeamPreference - preferences
	a) id
	b) user (FK)
	c) team (FK)

The flow of information will be as follows:
0) Team, TeamMapping, and API initialized via JSON
1) A user chooses preferred teams, which populate TeamPreference rows, which have a ForeignKey
   pointing to the User row
2) On request:
	a) A lookup of TeamPreference rows will be done
	b) For every TeamPreference row, we will get the Team ForeignKey, and lookup TeamMapping
	   rows with the:
		i ) Context specific API ForeignKey (hard-coded)
		ii) Team ForeignKey
	   and use the final column, representing the API foreign key, for the lookup 

Assumptions + "not doing this":
1) Currently making team as simple as possible, not adding league association at this point, will hard code it as part of the EPL
<--Scratch-->
Put Team, TeamMapping, and API in home
PUt TeamPreference in Preferences

DONE 1) Models
DONE 2) Instantiation
DONE 3) Mapping APIs

**********VIEW**********
1) Create a dynamically generated field, which will take all Team rows and
create BooleanFields (HTML inputs), with the id:

"team_[team_id]"

2) on GET, use the user ID to get pre-check all teams that are checked
3) on PUT, save to TeamPreference
4) Add bootstrap
