		  May be looking to use fantasy epl API for everything at first (rather than football-data,
		  with fantasy EPL data to grab teams that you have players on), but the APIs are

		  out to other leagues (and also not sure what the data differences are).

01/05/20 2:02AM - Finished initializing all data, now working on preferences
          view and model -- base case functional and unit coverage is complete,
          now working on the functionality.
