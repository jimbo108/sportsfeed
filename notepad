    User Story: Bob is a fan of Arsenal as well as Newcastle United.  He wants to see upcoming fixtures.
    He creates an account and logs into the site.  Bob is sent to a page where he chooses the teams he 
    wishes to follow.  He chooses Arsenal and Newcastle United from a checklist, and clicks through.  
    He now sees a feed of upcoming fixtures.  They are interlaced chronologically, and only contain 
    the teams involved as well as the home team.
