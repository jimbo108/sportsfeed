    User Story: Bob is a fan of Arsenal as well as Newcastle United.  He wants to see upcoming fixtures.
    He creates an account and logs into the site.  Bob is sent to a page where he chooses the teams he 
    wishes to follow.  He chooses Arsenal and Newcastle United from a checklist, and clicks through.  
    He now sees a feed of upcoming fixtures.  They are interlaced chronologically, and only contain 
    the teams involved as well as the home team.  
    
DONE 3. Replace custom user model with django user model

Issue:
Formset appears to be entirely unpopulated whenever self.fields is modified after the call to super() in
the TeamPreferenceForm __init__.  self.fields does not exist before the call to super().  Initial values
for fields can be overridden by modifying kwargs("initial").

Attempting to access any element in formset (form), I get a RelatedObjectDoesNotExist error for team.  
This behavior only occurs when I attempt to modify self.fields after the call to super().  
self.fields['is_preference'].label appears to be set to the correct value when debugging

Premises:
Modifying self.fields after the call to super() is the cause of this behavior

Hypotheses:
?
